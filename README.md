# Test assignments

This repo contains two test tasks I rewrote using Microsoft Style Guide principles.  
The user-guide.md is about managing user accounts, and money-transfer.md covers transferring money in T-Bank.  

Screenshots for the money transfer part are only in Russian, since T-Bank online banking doesnâ€™t offer an English interface.
